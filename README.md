# UaicNlpToolkit

This library consists of a set of NLP tools that I have developped during my Master and PhD studies at UAIC of Iași. The tools come preparred with resources for processing Romanian with as little effort as possible.

The toolkit currently contains
- Basic functionality for loading corpora in different formats that were frequently used in UAIC's NLP group, with limited support for automatic input format detection
- Graphical Grammar Studio (GGS)
- Annotations Explorer (initially part of GGS, now as a separate tool for browsing corpora)
- A morphological dictionary built for Romanian to enable support for easy switching between "diacritics only", "no diacritics" and "mixed diacritics" modes
- Uaic's hybrid part of speech tagger

This is a work in progress. I intend to include UAIC's Romanian dependency parser in this toolkit soon.
